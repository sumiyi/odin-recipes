## Project Information
This project is about creating a recipe website, using a combination of unordered/ordered lists, linking pages together, utilizing headers, and adding images. In general, the utmost basics of HTML to create a working webpage.

## Skills I have demonstrated
They way I look at it, this project was almost like learning to implement the basic functionalities of a docx file and translating that into an html file. I also learned how to publish my website on github and being able to access it from any device! I used my phone to access this website and that was actually really cool to experience. I previously learned how to use AWS for this but I think this is a great way to show my work in a very simple and quick way!

## Updates
Throughout the course, I will be updating this page to practice alongside the current course work.
